# 🏢 In-Person Residence Card Renewal Guide (窓口申請)

This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step process for renewing your Japanese Residence Card (`在留カード => zairyu kaado`) by visiting your regional Immigration Services Agency (ISA) office in person. This is the "traditional" or "offline" method.

This process involves **two separate visits** to the immigration office: one to submit your application and one to collect your new card after it's approved.

## 🌎 Overview: Online vs. In-Person

You have two methods for renewing your visa. Here are the trade-offs:

- **Online Method (Online Guide):**
  - **Pros:** Only requires mailing documents, not visiting the office.
  - **Cons:** Requires a lot of technical setup (MyNumber Card, IC card reader, JPKI software, etc.).
  - [See the Complete Online Guide here](./renewing-residence-card-online.md)
- **In-Person Method (This Guide):**
  - **Pros:** Requires no special software or hardware. You just need your documents.
  - **Cons:** You must physically go to the immigration office **twice**. Wait times are famously long (often 2-5 hours _per visit_).

---

## 📝 Step 1: Prepare Your Application Packet

This is the most important step. You must have all your documents printed and ready _before_ you go.

### 1. Download and Fill the Forms

You must download and print the official application forms.

- **ISA Application Forms List (Main Page):** [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/index.html](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/index.html)
- **Direct Links (Form No. 30-2):**
  - **Excel (`.xlsx`) format:** [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004115.xlsx](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004115.xlsx)
  - **PDF (`.pdf`) format:** [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004102.pdf](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004102.pdf)
- **Important:** You must download and print all parts for your visa type. This includes "For Applicant" (`申請人用`) and "For Organization" (`所属機関等作成用`).
- **Fill and Sign:** It is best to fill the forms using the Excel version, then print them. You must **physically sign** the "For Applicant" form with a pen.

#### Tips for Filling Forms

- **Write Your Name EXACTLY as it Appears on Your Residence Card:** This is a critical check. Look at your current residence card. Your name must be written in the exact same order and case.
  - _Example:_ On the application, write `CHOWDHURY ISHMAM ABIR` (all uppercase, family name first) if that is what is printed on your card.
- **Get Organization Part Filled:** Give the "For Organization" forms to your company's HR or school's administration office _at least_ one or two weeks in advance.
- **Proofread:** Double-check all details.

### 2. Prepare Supporting Documents

The required documents depend on your visa type.

- **For "Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/Int'l Services" Visa (and other work visas):**

  - The documents you need depend on your employer's "Category" (`カテゴリ`). **You must ask your company's HR which category it is.**
  - **Category 1 (`カテゴリ１`):** Publicly listed companies, etc. (Usually no extra docs needed).
  - **Category 2 (`カテゴリ２`):** Organizations that paid over 10 million JPY in withholding tax. (Need the annual withholding tax report, `法定調書合計表`).
  - **Category 3 (`カテゴリ３`):** Organizations that paid less than 10 million JPY. (Need the tax report _and_ the company's financial statements, `決算書`).
  - **Category 4 (`カテゴリ４`):** New companies. (Need financial statements, business plan, etc.).
  - **Source:** [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/gijinkoku.html](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/gijinkoku.html)

- **For All Applicants (Common Documents):**
  - **Tax & Income Certificates (`課税・納税証明書 => kazei/nouzei shoumeisho`):** The most recent certificates from your City/Ward Office (`市役所`). You can print these at a convenience store using your MyNumber Card.
  - **Your Passport:** Bring the original.
  - **Your Current Residence Card:** Bring the original.

### 3. Get a Physical ID Photo

- You need one **physical photo** (4cm x 3cm) taken within the last 3 months.
- You can get this from any ID photo booth (`証明写真機 => shoumei shashin ki`).
- Write your name on the back of the photo and **glue it** to the designated spot on the "For Applicant" application form.

## visit 1️⃣ Step 2: First Visit – Submitting Your Application

1. **Find Your Office:** You must go to the regional ISA office that has jurisdiction over your address.
2. **Go Early:** Arrive _before_ the office opens (e.g., by 8:30 AM). This is the most important tip to avoid waiting all day.
3. **Get a Number:** Go to the counter for "Residence Procedures" (`在留関係`) and get a numbered waiting ticket.
4. **Wait:** Wait for your number to be called. This can take several hours.
5. **Submit Documents:** When called, go to the counter and hand over your entire application packet (forms, passport, and residence card).
6. **Get Your Card Stamped:** The officer will check your documents. If everything is in order, they will take your current residence card and stamp the back of it with `申請中` (shinsei-chuu, "Application in Progress").
7. **Receive Your Passport:** They will return your passport and your residence card (with the new stamp). This stamp legally extends your period of stay for up to two months past your expiration date, so you are safe.
8. **Go Home:** Your first visit is complete.

## ✉️ Step 3: Waiting for Approval (The Postcard)

Now, you must wait. This can take anywhere from two weeks to two months.

- You will receive an official postcard (`はがき => hagaki`) in the mail from the immigration office.
- This postcard is your "Notice of Approval." It means your new residence card is ready to be collected.
- **Do not lose this postcard!** You must bring it with you to collect your card.

## visit 2️⃣ Step 4: Second Visit – Collecting Your New Card

1. **Prepare Your Items:** You must bring four things:
   1. The approval postcard (`はがき`).
   2. Your Passport.
   3. Your current Residence Card (with the `申請中` stamp).
   4. A **Revenue Stamp (`収入印紙 => shuunyuu inshi`)** for the renewal fee.
      - The fee is written on the postcard (e.g., ¥4,000 or ¥5,500).
      - You can buy this stamp at any post office or at the convenience store _inside_ the immigration building.
2. **Go to the Office:** Go back to the same immigration office.
3. **Attach the Stamp:** Go to the "Fee Payment" or "Stamp" counter. They will have a small form (the `手数料納付書` or _tesuuryou noufusho_). Stick your revenue stamp to this form.
4. **Get a Number:** Go to the "Collection/Pickup" (`受取`) counter and get a new waiting ticket.
5. **Wait:** This wait is usually shorter than the first visit, but can still be 1-2 hours.
6. **Collect Your Card:** When your number is called, hand over your postcard, passport, old residence card, and the form with the revenue stamp.
7. **Receive Your New Card:** They will give you your passport and your new residence card (they will punch a hole in your old one and return it to you). Your renewal is complete.

## 💡 Tips for Visiting the Immigration Office

- **Go Early, Go Early, Go Early:** Arrive at least 30 minutes before the office officially opens. You will be in a queue, but it's much better than arriving at 10 AM.
- **Bring a Book:** You will be waiting for hours. Bring a book, a portable battery for your phone, or work to do.
- **Bring Food/Water:** The cafeterias (if they exist) are not always great. Bring a snack.
- **Check the Date:** Avoid Mondays, Fridays, and the days immediately after a public holiday. These are the busiest times.
