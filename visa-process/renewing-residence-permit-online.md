## 📋 Prerequisites: What You Need

Before you begin, ensure you have the following items:

- **MyNumber Card (`マイナンバーカード => mai nanbaa kaado`):** Your physical card, not just the notification paper.
- **MyNumber Card Passwords:** You will need the 4-digit PIN and, most importantly, the 6-16 digit digital certificate password.
- **IC Card Reader (`ICカードリーダー => IC kaado riidaa`):** A USB device to read your MyNumber Card. **This is the highly recommended method.**
- **OR NFC-Enabled Smartphone:** A smartphone that can read the chip in your MyNumber Card.
  > **Note:** While this is an option, many users (including the author of this tip) report that it is difficult to get working. Save yourself the trouble and get a card reader.
- **A PC or Smartphone:** To access the application website.

---

## 🖥 Step 1: System Setup (PC & Software)

Before you can register, you must install the "JPKI" software, which allows the website to read your MyNumber Card.

### 1. Set Up Your IC Card Reader (Recommended Method)

1. **Purchase a Reader:** Buy a MyNumber Card compatible IC Card Reader. They are available on Amazon Japan, Rakuten, or at electronics stores like Yodobashi Camera or Bic Camera.
2. **Plug It In:** Connect the reader to your PC's USB port.

### 2. Install Required Software & Extensions

1. **JPKI Client Software:** This is the main software "driver."

   - **Go to the official JPKI Download Page:** [https://www.jpki.go.jp/download/index.html](https://www.jpki.go.jp/download/index.html)
   - **For PC (Windows/Mac):** Download and install the "JPKI Client Software" (`利用者クライアントソフト`).

2. **Browser Extension/Add-on (JPKI Bridge):**

   - The JPKI Client Software needs a "bridge" to communicate with your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
   - The client software installer will not prompt you to install this automatically.
   - Download and install the extension [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E8%80%85%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%82%BD%E3%83%95%E3%83%88-edgechrome/ddhaancdmkmeigppopkakhpbboccibla)

3. **Potential Java Requirement:**

   - Some users report needing **Java Runtime Environment 8.0**.
   - You can download it from the official Java website (search for "Java 8 download").
   - After installation, you can confirm it's recognized by checking for "Java" in your Windows Control Panel.

4. **For Non-Japanese Windows Users (!! IMPORTANT !!):**

   - The JPKI software may display garbled text (`文字化け => mojibake`) if your system's default language is not Japanese.
   - To fix this, you will need **Locale Emulator**.
   - **Download Locale Emulator:** [https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/](https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/)
   - After installing it, you must run the JPKI client software (and possibly your browser) by right-clicking and selecting "Run in Japanese" from the Locale Emulator menu.

5. **Run the JPKI Self-Test (!! CRITICAL !!):**
   - After installing all the above, run the JPKI Client Software.
   - It has a "Self-Test" (`自己診断`) or "Show Certificate" (`証明書を表示`) button.
   - Place your MyNumber Card on the reader and enter your password.
   - This test will confirm if:
     1. The reader is working.
     2. The software is installed.
     3. **The browser extension/bridge is working.**
   - **Do not proceed to Step 2 until this test passes.**

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Registering Your Account

Once your setup is working, you can create your account on the ISA system.

1. **Go to the ISA Online System:** [https://www.ras-immi.moj.go.jp/WC01/WCAAS010/](https://www.ras-immi.moj.go.jp/WC01/WCAAS010/)
2. **Start New Registration:** Click the button for "New User Registration" (`利用者情報登録`).
3. **Use a .jp Email Address:**
   - It is **highly recommended** to use a Japanese email address. Some users report issues with foreign email providers.
   - You can get a free `@yahoo.co.jp` address. After registration, you can set it to forward emails to your primary account.
4. **Agree to Terms:** Read and agree to the terms of service.
5. **Authenticate:** The site will now ask you to authenticate.
   - **!! PASSWORD WARNING !!:** You will need your 6-16 digit digital certificate password. This password is very likely **ALL-UPPERCASE**, even if you remember setting it as lowercase or mixed-case.
   - Try the **all-uppercase** version of your password first.
   - If you fail 5 times, your card will be **locked**, and you must visit your city office to unlock it. Be very careful.
6. **Create Account:** Once authenticated, you will be asked to create a User ID and Password for the site.
7. **Confirmation:** You will receive a confirmation email. Your account is now ready.

---

## 📝 Step 3: Download & Complete the Application Forms

This is the most important part of the preparation. You **must** download the official application forms, fill them out, print, sign, and scan them.

### 1. Download the Official Forms

Go to the ISA's official forms page to get the correct files for your visa type.

- **ISA Application Forms List (Main Page):** [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/16-3.html](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/16-3.html)
- **Direct Links (Form No. 30-2):**
  - **Excel (`.xlsx`) format:** [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004121.xlsx](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004121.xlsx)
  - **PDF (`.pdf`) format:** [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004094.pdf](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004094.pdf)
- **Important:** You must download all the parts for your visa type. This includes "For Applicant" (`申請人用`) and "For Organization" (`所属機関等作成用`).

### 2. Fill and Sign the Forms

1. **Fill Electronically:** Use the Excel version to type all your information. It is much cleaner and more professional than handwriting.
2. **Get Organization Part Filled:** Send the "For Organization" (`所属機関等作成用`) forms to your company's HR or school's administration office. Give them at least one or two weeks to complete it.
3. **Print and Sign:** Once all forms (both your part and the organization's part) are complete, print them.
4. **Physically Sign:** Go to the designated signature box on the "For Applicant" form and **physically sign** it with a pen.
5. **Scan:** Scan the completed and signed paper forms to PDF.

### Tips for Filling Forms

- **Write Your Name EXACTLY as it Appears on Your Residence Card:** This is a critical check. Look at your current residence card. Your name must be written in the exact same order and case.
  - _Example:_ On the application, write `CHOWDHURY ISHMAM ABIR` (all uppercase, family name first) if that is what is printed on your card. Do not write "Ishmam Abir Chowdhury".
- **Consistency is Key:** Your name, passport number, and residence card number must be _exactly_ the same across all documents.
- **Proofread:** Double-check everything. Ask a Japanese-speaking friend or colleague to review the forms for any simple mistakes.

---

## 📄 Step 4: Prepare Supporting Documents

In addition to the main application form, you must gather and scan all other supporting documents. The required documents depend on your visa type.

### 1. For "Engineer/Specialist in Humanities/Int'l Services" Visa (and other work visas)

This is the most important step for work visas. The documents you need depend on your company's "Category" (`カテゴリ`). **You must ask your company's HR which category it is.**

- **Category 1 (`カテゴリ１`):** Publicly listed companies, government organizations, etc.
- **Category 2 (`カテゴリ２`):** Organizations that paid over 10 million JPY in withholding tax last year or fullfills other conditions.
- **Category 3 (`カテゴリ３`):** Organizations that paid less than 10 million JPY in withholding tax last year.
- **Category 4 (`カテゴリ４`):** New companies or organizations with no withholding tax record or companies that doesn't fit on above categories.

**Source:** You can see these categories on the official ISA page for the "Engineer" visa and confirm which document is needed for your company's category: [https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/gijinkoku.html](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/gijinkoku.html)

> **Document Checklist** [Here](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001367009.pdf)

### 2. Documents for All Applicants

You will almost always need to provide these, regardless of your visa type:

1. **Tax & Income Certificates (`課税・納税証明書 => kazei/nouzei shoumeisho`):**

   - **Source:** Your local City/Ward Office (`市役所・区役所 => shiyakusho/kuyakusho`).
   - **How to get:** The fastest way is to use your MyNumber Card at a multi-copy machine in any major convenience store (`コンビニ => conbini`) to print them.
   - You need the **most recent** certificates showing your total income and that your residence tax is paid.

2. **Scans of Residence Card & Passport:**

   - Scan your Residence Card (front and back).
   - Scan your Passport (the photo/information page).

3. **Digital ID Photo (`証明写真 => shoumei shashin`):**
   - A recent, passport-style digital photo (plain background, facing forward). This is usually uploaded as a separate file, not part of the main PDF.

---

## 🧬 Step 5: Merge & Compress All Files into One PDF

The online portal has a strict file size limit (often 10MB total). You must merge all your scanned files from **Step 3** and **Step 4** into a _single PDF file_.

> **⚠ Privacy Note:** You will be uploading highly sensitive documents. While free online tools are widely used and secure, you are using them at your own discretion.

### Step-by-Step: Using iLovePDF

1. **Gather Your Files:** Collect all your scanned PDFs:
   - The completed and signed Application Forms (from Step 3)
   - All Supporting Documents (from Step 4, _except_ the ID photo)
2. **Go to iLovePDF:** [https://www.ilovepdf.com](https://www.ilovepdf.com)
3. **Merge PDF:**
   - Select the **"Merge PDF"** tool.
   - Upload all your individual files.
   - Drag and drop them into a logical order (e.g., Application, Passport, Residence Card, Company Docs, Tax Certs).
   - Click **"Merge PDF"** and download the combined file.
4. **Compress PDF:**
   - Check the file size. If it's over 10MB, go back to the iLovePDF homepage.
   - Select the **"Compress PDF"** tool.
   - Upload the large merged file.
   - Choose **"Recommended compression"** (this is usually enough).
   - Click **"Compress PDF"** and download your final, small file. **This is the file you will upload.**

---

## 📤 Step 6: Submit via the Online Portal

Now you use the online system to submit your application.

1. **Log In:** Go to the [ISA Online System](https://www.ras-immi.moj.go.jp/WC01/WCAAS010/) and log in.
2. **Start Application:** Find and select the "Application for Extension of Period of Stay" (`在留期間更新許可申請 => Zairyū kikan kōshin kyoka shinsei`).
3. **Complete the Web Form:** The portal will ask you to fill in _basic_ information (like your name, residence card number, etc.). This is _in addition_ to the forms you already filled out.
4. **!! CRITICAL: Check Files Before Uploading !!**
   - The online system **does not allow you to delete or replace a file** once you have uploaded it.
   - Before proceeding, **TRIPLE-CHECK** that your digital ID photo is correct and that your merged PDF contains all the correct, signed, and clearly scanned documents.
5. **Upload Your Files:** The system will prompt you to upload:
   - Your Digital ID Photo (from Step 4)
   - Your single, merged, compressed PDF (from Step 5)
6. **Click the Final "Submit" Button:**
   - After all files are uploaded, you **must** click the final "Submit" (`申請`) button.
   - Your application **will not proceed** just by uploading the files. You must confirm the submission. You should receive a confirmation email and a receipt number (`申請受付番号 => Shinsei uketsuke bangō`) almost immediately.
7. **Wait for Review:** After submission, your application status will be "under review." This process can take several weeks to a few months.

---

## ✅ Step 7: After Approval - Receiving the "Notice of Completion"

You will eventually receive an automated email from the immigration system (`在留申請オンラインシステム`) stating that your application review is complete (`審査が完了しました`).

This email is _not_ the final approval. It is the notification that it's time to complete the final step: mailing your documents to get the new card printed. The email will list the _exact_ documents you need to send.

---

## 📮 Step 8: Mailing Your Documents to Immigration

Once you receive the approval email, you must mail the following items to the address specified in the email (typically within 14 days).

> **Note:** The address below is an _example_ from the email you provided. **You must send your documents to the address in YOUR email.**
>
> ```text
> 〒135-0064
> 東京都江東区青海2-7-11 東京港湾合同庁舎 9階
> 東京出入国在留管理局オンライン審査部門オンライン申請手続班（おだいば分室内）
> ```

Here is what you need to send:

1. **Return Envelope (`返信用封筒 => henshinyou fuutou`):**

   - The easiest option is a **Letter Pack Plus (`レターパックプラス => retaapakku purasu`)**, which you can buy at any convenience store. Write your own name and address in the "To" field.
   - Write your Application Receipt Number (`申請受付番号`) from the email on the _back_ of the return envelope.

2. **Payment Form (`手数料納付書 => tesuuryou noufusho`):**

   - Download the form [here (PDF)](http://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002833.pdf).
   - Buy a **Revenue Stamp (`収入印紙 => shuunyuu inshi`)** for the required amount (e.g., ¥5,500 as specified in your email).
   - Stick the revenue stamp onto the payment form.
   - Fill in your Application Receipt Number (`申請受付番号`) and your Name (`氏名`) on the form.

   ![Payment form fillup guide](../resources/images/visa-process/renew-payment-form.png)

3. **Your Current Residence Card (`在留カード => zairyu kaado`):**

   - Yes, you must send the **original** card.
   - **!! IMPORTANT !!:** Before you mail it, **make a high-quality color copy (front and back)**.
   - On the _back_ of the copy, write the information from your email:

     ```text
     申請受付日：<Your Application Date, e.g., 2025年10月7日>
     申請受付番号：<Your Receipt Number, e.g., 福オンＥＮ25001878>
     ```

   - You **must** carry this copy and your passport with you at all times as proof of your status until your new card arrives.

4. **Designation Paper (`指定書 => shiteisho`) (If applicable):**
   - If your visa status is "Highly-Skilled Professional," "Specified Skilled Worker," or "Designated Activities," send this paper.
   - **DO NOT send your passport.**

---

## 📬 Step 9: Receiving Your New Residence Card

After you mail the documents, all you have to do is wait.

- You can track your outgoing Letter Pack to see when it arrives at the immigration office.
- Within a week or two, your new Residence Card will arrive at your home in the return envelope you provided.
- They will also return your old card, which will have a hole punched in it to show it is invalid.

> **Note**: Update your new recidence status in your bank account, MyNumber Card & other documents after receiving your new residence card.

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- **Save Your Progress:** The online system can time out. Save your application as a draft (`一時保存`) frequently.
- **Apply Early:** The system allows you to apply 3 months before your card expires. Do it as soon as possible.
- **Use Convenience Stores:** Getting your tax certificates (`課税・納税証明書`) from a convenience store using your MyNumber Card is the fastest and easiest way.
- **Letter Pack Plus:** Use the red `Letter Pack Plus` (¥600) for mailing your card. It's tracked and requires a signature, giving you peace of mind. Alternatively, you can also use `Letter Pack Light` or `Envelope with Stamps` but those can't be tracked.
- **Digital Photo:** You can take a high-quality photo with your smartphone against a plain white wall. Crop it to the correct aspect ratio, and it's usually accepted.
- **Adobe Scan:** A free mobile app for your phone (iOS/Android). It's excellent for scanning documents clearly and saving them directly as a PDF.

---

## ⚠ Important Warnings

- **File Uploads are Final (!! CRITICAL !!)**

  - The online system **does not allow you to delete or re-upload** files. If you upload the wrong photo or the wrong PDF, you cannot fix it. You must be 100% sure your files are correct _before_ you upload them in Step 6.

- **MyNumber Card Password (!! CRITICAL !!)**

  - The 6-16 digit digital certificate password (the one used for authentication) is often **all-uppercase**.
  - Many users have locked their cards by repeatedly trying a lowercase or mixed-case password.
  - Before you start, try to recall if your password was all caps. If you fail 5 times, your card will be **locked**, and you **must** go to your city/ward office in person to reset it.

- **Do Not Miss the Deadline:** You must complete this mail-in process and receive your new card. If you let your current card expire and 2 months pass, you could lose your residency status.

- **No "Minashi" Re-entry:** While your old residence card is in the mail, you **cannot** leave and re-enter Japan using the Special Re-entry Permit (`みなし再入国許可 => minashi sai'nyuukoku kyoka`). If you have an emergency and must leave Japan, you must go to your local immigration office in person to apply for a standard re-entry permit _before_ you mail your card.

- **Report Changes:** If your situation changes _after_ you applied (e.g., you lost or quit your job), you must contact the immigration office immediately. Receiving a new card based on old information can lead to your visa being revoked.
