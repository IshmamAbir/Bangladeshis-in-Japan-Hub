  - Often preferred for certain professions and international driving.

If you pass both the theory and practical test then you will get your lerner's permit and prepare for the next phase (honmen/main license test).

  - Practical test on a closed course (at the school track).
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Basic driving maneuvers (turning, braking, parking).
  - Vehicle control and safety checks.

### 2. **Honmen (Êú¨ÂÖç) - Final License Phase**

After completing the lerner's permit phase, you can start the final phase of getting your main license. This phase includes a written test and a practical test on public roads.

- **Requirements:**
  - Pass the theory test (100 questions).

## üõµ Moped License

### Moped Licence Acquiring Process

This process only requires a written test. You don't need to take a driving test. The test is a multiple choice test. 50 questions will be provided to you.

After passing the test, the staff will take you to a classroom for a driving safety class. It takes about an hour and is conducted in Japanese. Just nod and smile; they will probably assume you do not understand, but it won‚Äôt matter, this is not a graded exercise, and as long as you stay awake, you should be OK.

After the class, the staff will take you to a driving course for your 3-hour Safe Driving Course, where an instructor will introduce you to the basics of the scooter: how to use the kickstand, start it, accelerate, brake, etc. After the class, you will get your license if you have managed not to hurt yourself or others.

### Rules for Moped Riders

- **Maximum Speed:** 30 km/h.
- **Prohibited Roads:** Highways and expressways.
- **Bike Lane Usage:** Permitted unless otherwise indicated.
- **Helmet:** Wearing a helmet is mandatory.
- **Passenger Restrictions:** No passengers allowed on mopeds.
